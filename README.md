This is a sample project outlining how you can build a simple React Native application with Redux. I've decided to use Spoonacular as a RESTful endpoint for demonstrating how we can make asynchronous calls within the Redux pattern.

Make sure you modify lib/api.js and provide a valid API key once you've registered here: https://market.mashape.com/spoonacular/recipe-food-nutrition/pricing
